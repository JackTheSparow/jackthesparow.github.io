## About

Hi I'm Jack. I am a computer enthusiast and I like to know use and about new technology. 
This is my blog and I will be posting here my CTF writeups and other cool stuff that I will be discovering on the way.
I play CTF with [Maple Bacon](https://maplebacon.org/)

So I have come throgh a definition that defines my experience of using Linux.

Linux is only free if your time has no value. 

Meaning: Although using computers always takes time. Its about Linux that takes time to configure everything and customizing packages after some
tinkering around. Therfore we can say that we have to use Linux at the cost of time that we take out for its working and it's not free.

Cool definition according to Windows users, isn't it. Well it is a little contradictory according to some of my other collegues.

Learning an operating system takes time, nothing is perfect. If anyone has installed a fresh Windows and is using for the first time, it would take time 
for him to learn its mechanism. Once you learn to use linux, it becomes easier to work around using script and automation. It's far easier to get the 
software, configs and settings someone want installed through a script than it is to install things on a windows machine.

Above is the conversation between my friends regarding the original statement.
