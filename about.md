Hello, I'm NC, and I go by JackTheSparow on the Internet. I play Capture The Flag(Cybersecurity Competitions) with [Maple Bacon](https://maplebacon.org/about/).

I will be sharing my experiences and insights on various topics related to Cybersecurity, Linux, Programming and much more. In
particular, I will be posting [Capture The Flag](https://maplebacon.org/getting_started/) Writeups, detailing my thought 
process and solutions for various 
challenges. If you're a seasoned cybersecurity professional I look forward for your feedback and tips. And if you're a beginner and just starting out, I hope that my blog will provide you with valuable information and inspiration.

Stay tuned for more updates and feel free to leave comments or suggestions through Email and Github.
