    <p>I am thrilled to share the story of how my team, Pirates Bay,
achieved an incredible victory in the 24-hour Cybersecurity
hackathon named CyberCup.</p>

As the lead Cybersecurity Architect, you have been asked to develop a cybersecurity program for the university and present your strategy for detection, containing and removal of the malware as well as your implementation and execution roadmap to the Executive Committee (EC). It should also be noted that its Registration time of the year, therefore LMS portal is in active use and cannot be shut down, as students are entering sensitive information as their address, mobile number and bank account.
