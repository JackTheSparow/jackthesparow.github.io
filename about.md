Hello World, I am NC and I go by Jack Sparow on the Internet. I play Capture The Flag(CTFs) in Reverse Engineering, Forensics, OSINT & Misc Categories. Configuring and troubleshooting Linux systems has been my source of dopamine for over five years. 

I regularly participate in Cybersecurity Competitions including but not limited to:

- Department of Energy's [Cyberforce](https://cyberforce.energy.gov/cyberforce-competition/prior-competitions/doe-cyberforce-competition-2024/)
- [NSA Codebreakers](https://nsa-codebreaker.org/leaderboard)
- [SECCDC](https://cyberflorida.org/seccdc/)(Southeast Colligiate Cyber Defense Competition)
- Weekly Jeopardy Style CTFs

CTF Teams

- [Maple Bacon](https://maplebacon.org/about/) @ University of British Columbia
- [Cyber Hawks](https://cyberhawks.org/) @ University of North Georgia

I will be updating my writeups and insights on linux, new projects and other Cybersecurity related issues soon.

Stay tuned for more updates and feel free to communicate through Email.
