I am thrilled to share the story of how my team, Pirates Bay,
achieved an incredible victory in the 24-hour Cybersecurity
hackathon named CyberCup.

CyberCup was a 24 Hours hackathon organized by Amity University Noida, starting 18th January 2023.

There were three themes for the Hackathon: IoT & Robotics, Cybersecurity & Blockchain and Healthcare.

The Problem Statement for [Cybersecurity and Blockchain](https://amity.edu/aset/confluence2023/problem_statement_cb.html) is as follows:

You are the Lead Cybersecurity Architect for the newly formed department of Cybersecurity and Compliance (CSAC) within a university.
In 2020, University discovered a serious cyber-attack. There was a Supply Chain Attack as advised by a trusted intel, in a coding library which is used in creation of LMS (Learning Management system)portal.
The Senior Management Executive Committee has recently earmarked funding to implement an enterprise-wide cybersecurity program that aligns to the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework. As the lead Cybersecurity Architect, you have been asked to develop a cybersecurity program for the university and present your strategy for detection, containing and removal of the malware as well as your implementation and execution roadmap to the Executive Committee (EC). It should also be noted that its Registration time of the year, therefore LMS portal is in active use and cannot be shut down, as students are entering sensitive information as their address, mobile number and bank account.
You are part of a cybersecurity team comprised of a risk analyst, three cybersecurity analysts and a coop student. The university has multiple lines of business and academic programs. University has multiple campuses including international offices. University has domestic students as well as international students.
Note: Note that your target audience is the Executive Management of the Enterprise

Our Solution:

In order to make the story seem realistic we designed a scenario of attacking a Systems Engineer with Admin Privileges from a famous Supply Chain Service Provider to the College.
